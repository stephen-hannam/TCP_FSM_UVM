## Self-study UVM

UVM and Systemverilog self-study goal-oriented project.

### Approach

Use fizzim to construct the various FSMs for phases of TCP connections, and then verify them using UVM (and Systemverilog constructs).

### External Resources

Various images in the repo were pulled from online.

Very details slides describing the core workings of TCP can be found [here](https://www.slideshare.net/PeterREgli/tcp-6027334).
