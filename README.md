## Self-study UVM

UVM and Systemverilog self-study goal-oriented project. The chosen goal will be the design and implementation of a TCP connection controller, centering on a Finite State Machine (FSM) representing the core functionality for establishing and terminating connections in TCP.

### Approach

Use fizzim to construct the various FSMs for phases of TCP connections, and then verify them using UVM (during the course of which synth'able and non-synth'able Systemverilog constructs will also be covered).

UVM will be expedited by Easier-UVM from [Doulos](https://www.doulos.com/knowhow/sysverilog/uvm/).

### External Resources

Various images in the repo were pulled from online.

Very details slides describing the core workings of TCP can be found [here](https://www.slideshare.net/PeterREgli/tcp-6027334).
